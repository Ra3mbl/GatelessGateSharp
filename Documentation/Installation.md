# Gateless Gate Sharp Online Manual

## Installation

The most recent information about installing Gateless Gate Sharp (GGS) can be found at 
[https://github.com/zawawawa/GatelessGateSharp](https://github.com/zawawawa/GatelessGateSharp).
It is highly recommended that you run an .msi installer instead of downloading .7z/zip archives as the installer automatically takes care of the required dependencies.
Also, please make sure that you have an appropriate display driver installed 
on your computer. Please note that **Blockchain drivers and modded BIOS'es are not supported!**

If you experience problems launching the application after the installation, you could try to install the following dependencies manually: 

* [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56116)

* [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
